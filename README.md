- [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/)

### Quick installation & setup 

- Fork this repository and download locally with ```git clone [YOUR REPO]```
- CD into your js app root with ```cd decoupled-js/```
- You will now install the required node modules with ```npm install```
- You can serve your JS app with ```npm start``` and test at ```http://localhost:8080``` 

### Additional setup and local development

â€“ To develop with this application locally, you should address the `@todo` comments in `client/config/environment.js`, such as changing the API endpoint to a local Drupal application. Note that you will need to re-run `npm install` after changing any variables in this file.
